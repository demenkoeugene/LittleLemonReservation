# LittleLemonReservation
My completed project for the course Create the User Interface with SwiftUI by Meta

I followed the following steps:

* I created a view containing the Little Lemon restaurant logo.
* I added this view to the LocationsView.
* I added the LocationsView to the MainView.
* I created a Text element that displays one of two strings, depending on the state of the variable.
* Create a dynamic list of items that contains several restaurant locations.
* Added a NavigationLink to the list to make each restaurant location clickable.
* Create a validation code for a text box.
* Made the booking button launch the form validation function when clicked.
* And added an alert to the view that shows errors contained in the variable
